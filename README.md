## INTERNET TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS ##
### Summer 2016 ###

#### PROJECTS:
    * PA1 : Chat application over TCP/IP connection
    * PA2 : Reliable File Broadcast over UDP/IP

Please refer to each project folder for more information.

IMPORTANT NOTE: pa1 and pa2 have an excessively use of channels, rather
than a blocking primitive mechanism. No mutex was used in the project,
which is a bad convention.
